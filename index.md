### Some intresting Physics Problems that I solved while working as Tutor at Chegg and [Coursehero](https://www.coursehero.com/profile/kagey4ma1/)

#### Python

1. [Statics Problem to solve a system of equations symbolically using SymPy](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/physics-statics-problem-sympy/physics-statics-problem-sympy.ipynb)
2. [Plotting energy stored in a capacitor vs time using matplotlib](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/physics-energy-stored-capacitor-python/physics-energy-stored-capacitor-python.ipynb)

#### MATLAB/Octave
1. [Solving a system of 3x3 equations using solve](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/octave-solving-systems-of-equation.ipynb)
2. [Solving a system of 4x4 equations by Gauss-Jordan Elimination](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/octave-gauss-jordan-elimination-4x4.ipynb)
