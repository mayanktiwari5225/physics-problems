## Physics Problems

Some intresting Physics Problems that I solved while working as Tutor at Chegg and Coursehero.

1. [Statics Problem to solve a system of equations symbolically using SymPy](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/physics-statics-problem-sympy/physics-statics-problem-sympy.ipynb)
2. [Solving a system of 4x4 equations using Gauss-Jordan Elimination](https://github.com/python4phys1cs/physics-problems/blob/main/octave-gauss-jordan-elimination-4x4.ipynb)
